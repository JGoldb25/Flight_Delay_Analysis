# Flight_Delay_Analysis
Uncovering flight insights using BTS data!

Data: Analyzing data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS)

Mission: I am investigating Departure Delay times from two New York Airports (LGA and JFK)

Data Selection: As the BTS database for Reporting Carrier On-Time Performance contains data on 105+ variables for each year since 1987, I selected a list of 25 variables to evaluate in greater detail below, looking at a random Month/Year combination: March, 2019

Question: Is the Average Departure Delay greater at LGA or JFK?

Hypothesis: Specifically, I hypothesize that the Average Departure Delay for LGA is greater than the comparable metric total for JFK
